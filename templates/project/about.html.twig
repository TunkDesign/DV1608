    <h1>About this project</h1>
    <p>
        This is a school project where I have built a browser-based poker game using Symfony. It's a simplified version of Five Card Draw Poker where you play against two computer-controlled opponents, one called "Monkey" (plays randomly) and one "Computer" (plays with basic logic).
    </p>
    <p>
        The game includes everything from dealing cards, two rounds of betting, an optional card exchange, and finally a showdown to determine the winner.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also built a JSON API so the game can be controlled programmatically. There is an <a href="{{ path('poker_api') }}">API page</a> where you can try out all the endpoints directly in the browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal was to practice working with sessions, building APIs, and using JavaScript to update the UI dynamically.
